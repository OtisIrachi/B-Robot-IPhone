# B-Robot-IPhone
B-Robot using ESP32 and TouchOSC with iPad/iPhone.

Had a hard time find a TouchOSC App that actually worked.
Through trial and error and a bit of luck, this one works well.

Robot body was printed mostly by using JJRobots 3D files.
Some were modified to accomodate my ESP32 Motherboard and
a 1400maH Li-Poly Battery.
