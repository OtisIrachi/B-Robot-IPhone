# B-Robot for iPhone using TouchOSC
A Self Balancing Robot based on ESP32 and MPU6050, 
can be controlled using iPad or iPhone over Wifi.
Had a hard time finding any TouchOSC based project that actually
worked. By trial and error and a little luck, got this one working.
 
Robot body construction is made from JJRobots 3D Print Files.
A couple were modified to accomodate my ESP32 motherboard
and a larger Li_poly battery.
